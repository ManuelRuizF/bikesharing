# Bikesharing Analysis 
[Link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/bikesharing_ManuelRuiz/Checkouttimeforusers#1)

## Overview  

For this project we want to analyze bikesharing data from CitiBike in New York City. In order to create a presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. We won´t start big, since New York´s population is really different from Des Moines. And finally create the solid business proposal.  
  
We want to create the following visualizations to...:  
  
- ...show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.  
- ...show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.  
- ...show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  

## Results

### Checkout Time for Users  
![image1](https://github.com/ManuelRuizF/bikesharing/blob/main/images/CheckoutTime_ForUsers_Viz.PNG)  
In this visualization we can see that the average person doesn´t spend more than an hour on the ride. We can infer from the distances where to put the start or stop points in Des Moines.  
### Checkout Time for Users by gender  
![image2](https://github.com/ManuelRuizF/bikesharing/blob/main/images/CheckoutTime_byGender.PNG)  
In this visualization of number of rides by duration, separated by gender, it shows how many more rides are taken by male customers.  
### Trips by Weekday  
![image3](https://github.com/ManuelRuizF/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20gender%20and%20hour.PNG)  
In this visualization we can see the heavy bike usage during weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day.The day with the least usage is Wednesday. What are the reasons?... Would this appky in Des Moines as well?  
Also, we can still see that low-usage time in the early morning hours, every day of the week.


### Trips by gender / hour  
![image4](https://github.com/ManuelRuizF/bikesharing/blob/main/images/Trips%20by%20gender%20and%20weekday.PNG)  
 This heatmap reinforces how much of the users are males. 
 Could this be because of excercise reasons? or maybe women don´t feel safe in the city of New York... Maybe in the city of Des Moines women would feel safe.  
 
 Finally we can see that the best times people use the bikes are after the office time... This is a helpful insight since we want to know when are we going to repair the broken bikes.

 ## Tools
 - Jupyter Notebook
 - Python
 
   
   

## Summary
In a really busy city like New York, the buyer persona for this business is a male that rides the bike before and after office.   
These are my 2 recommendations for more visualizations in the future:  
- Study the average age people use the service. Maybe the Des Moines´s population  is more of old people and our targets are millenials!  
- Also, the distances from the corporatives and the residencial areas. We want to know the average distance a worker would travel.
